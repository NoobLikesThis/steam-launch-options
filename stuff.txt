ALL RENDERING OPTIONS:
DIRECTX OPTIONS:
directx 10: -dx10
directx 11: -dx11
directx 12: -dx12
THESE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WORK IN CERTAIN GAMES
below:
-nod3d9ex
Disables Direct3D 9Ex (D3D9Ex), which can help if you're experiencing performance issues related to graphics.
-dxlevel [level]
Forces a specific DirectX version when launching the game. This is useful if your graphics hardware is older, and gets significantly better performance in an earlier version of DirectX. Below are the most common modes used:
-dxlevel 80
-dxlevel 81
-dxlevel 90
-dxlevel 95
-dxlevel 98 
OPENGL:
-gl
Forces the game to use OpenGL rendering instead of DirectX.
VULKAN:
-vulkan
Forces the game to use vulkan rendering instead of DirectX.

Advanced/Specific Steam Launch Options:
1. -autoconfig
Resets video and performance settings to default for the game.
2. -safe
Launches the game in safe mode, with minimal settings, useful for troubleshooting crashes.
3. -console
Enables the in-game developer console (if available in the game).
4. -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
Disables mouse acceleration and forces default mouse settings in Source engine games like CS
5. +cl_forcepreload 1
Forces the game to preload all textures and models before entering the game. This can reduce in-game stuttering but may increase loading times.
6. -lv
Enables low violence mode in games that support it (e.g., Counter-Strike series).
7. -dxlevel [version]
Forces a specific DirectX version. Example: -dxlevel 90 for DirectX 9. Some older games can run better on lower versions of DirectX.
8. +mat_antialias 0 and +mat_forceaniso 1
Disables anti-aliasing and forces anisotropic filtering, useful for improving performance in Source engine games.
9. +cl_showfps 1
Displays an FPS counter in-game for Source engine games.
10. -nocrashdialog
Disables crash reporting dialogue boxes, allowing quicker restarts if a crash occurs.

VR-Specific Steam Launch Options:
1. -vr
Forces the game to launch in VR mode.
2. -noipd
Disables inter-pupillary distance adjustments for VR games.
3. -openvr
Forces the game to use the OpenVR platform instead of other VR APIs.

-heapsize (RAM x 524228)
Adjust RAM minimum allocation
Check RAM memory to : Task Manager - Performance tab - Memory section
Example : 4GB -heapsize 2096912 / 8GB -heapsize 4194304 / 16GB -heapsize 8388608

-maxMem=(RAM x 1024)
Adjust RAM maximum allocation
Check RAM memory to : Task Manager - Performance tab - Memory section
Example : 4GB -maxMem=4096 / 8GB -maxMem=8192 / 16GB -maxMem=16384

-maxVram=(VRAM x 1024 - 512)
Ajdust GPU's RAM(VRAM) maximum allocation
Check GPU's RAM(VRAM) memory to : Task Manager - Performance tab - GPU section - Dedicated GPU memory
Example : 3GB -maxVram=2560 / 4GB -maxVram=3584 / 6GB -maxVram=5632 / 8GB -maxVram=7168

-cpuCount=(number)
Set CPU Cores allocation
Check CPU threads to : Task Manager - Performance tab - CPU section - Cores

-threads (number)
Set CPU threads allocation
Check CPU threads to : Task Manager - Performance tab - CPU section - Logical processors


    -noforcemparms
        Uses the mouse configuration settings defined in Windows Control Panel Mouse settings, use all windows mouse settings/thresholds. This should technically be the same as when all three are combined (-noforcemparms -noforcemspd -noforcemaccel), see github code reference below
    -noforcemspd
        Uses windows defined mouse Enhanced Pointer Precision settings, if disabled in windows will be disabled in-game with this option
    -noforcemaccel
        Uses windows mouse threshold settings for acceleration, determines how acceleration is multiplied
    -nomsaa
        Disables in-game post processing anti-aliasing, this is automatically implied when -nofbo is used.
    -stretchaspect
        The game by default adds black bars based on your game screen resolution. Use -stretchaspect on your command line if you want the old behavior back (just always fill the screen). Setting "-nofbo" also implies "-stretchaspect".
    -freq <monitor refresh rate>
        e.g. -freq 144
        This sets the monitors refresh rate when the game is launched, set this to a higher value if your monitor supports it (100hz, 120hz, 144hz)
        This setting works with the new rendering mode (when you do not have -nofbo specified)
        In order to get the proper monitor refresh rate with -nofbo enabled you must set your desktop refreshrate to the desired refreshrate first, assuming the in-game resolution supports the refresh rate.
    -nofbo
        Uses the rendering method similar to the one before the 2013 updates, this may improve performance on some PCs. See note above regarding nofbo and in-game monitor refresh rate. This also implies the use of -nomsaa

Common Launch Option Settings:

With Old Rendering Method (nofbo)

    -noforcemparms -noforcemspd -noforcemaccel -nofbo -freq <refreshrate>
